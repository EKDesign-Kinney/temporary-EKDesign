				<h2>About Me (Kinney)</h2>
				<p>I grew up in Katoomba from age 1, and although I’ve tried to escape a few times, this place has called me back every time.</Br></Br>

				I’ve always had a love of art and creativity and, as I faced my final years of high school, I was confronted with the question of how to make creativity my life… And pay the bills. So, I dropped out of school. Plot twist! </Br></Br>

				At age 16, I took a year-long Diploma course in Graphic Design at CATC in Ultimo. I fell in love with design – not just the creative aspect of it, but its practical beauty, as well. Design overlaps with psychology, sociology, economics, mathematics, linguistics and, of course, the arts. It had my attention from the start.</Br></Br>

				Over the years since I graduated, I’ve taken work in hospitality and studied some more. I’ve tapped into my love of writing, drawing, painting and making music and, most recently, dance. I’m known to collect hobbies and interests like a dragon hoarding rubies. </Br></Br>

				But I’ve always come back to design. Design is everywhere, constantly engaging my creative muscle and challenging what I know about effective visual communication and marketing. Strangely, it is perhaps bad design which motivates me to put my best work out there, most of all.</Br></Br>

				Before I started the business, I took a few jobs for charity and small businesses in my hometown. With each project, I was reminded of my passion for my work. At the same time, it became increasingly clear that the main source of work in a tourist town – hospitality – is not my forté.</Br></Br>

				It is obvious to me now that building a career in graphic design is inevitable, and it just so happens that corporate design is what grabs me. Creating a brand identity, building graphics that are rich with symbolism and geometry, putting a company’s best face forward for the world to see… It excites me. I want to become a master, if that’s even possible, and to have some influence on the calibre of design on the market. Design can always be improved, and I find making my own contribution to it immensely satisfying.</Br></Br>

				Now you know who I am and why I do business. That, plus my drive to create and my experience in graphic design, is what I have to offer.</Br></Br>
